/*
   This interface extends MongoRepository, which provides CRUD operations for the Appointment entity
   The first parameter is the entity type (Appointment), and the second is the type of the entity's ID (String)
   No additional methods are defined here, but you can add custom query methods if needed
   For example, you could add a method to find appointments by a specific field, like date or user
   Example: List<Appointment> findByDate(Date date);
   You can also use Spring Data's query derivation feature to create methods based on the naming convention
   For example, if you have a field 'date' in the Appointment entity, you could create a method like:
   List<Appointment> findByDate(Date date);
